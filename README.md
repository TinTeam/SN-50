## About SN-50

SN-50 is a free and open source fantasy computer for building, playing and sharing resources-limited games. The game limitations were inspired in old computers and their text-based games.

The project is basically a simple console and several tools for building games, as such: code, glyph, sound and music editors. Games are saved, packed and distributed in cartridge files. These files can be executed by the SN-50 or any player that implements the console specifications.
